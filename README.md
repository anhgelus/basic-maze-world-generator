# Basic Maze World Generator

Spigot plugin modifying the default Minecraft generation by replacing it by a maze.

Maze generated by [this CLI App](https://github.com/msmp-mc/maze-generator-cli).

## Usage

Put the plugin inside your `plugins` folder.

Start the server and stop it (it will stop by itself because an error occurs: the config was not set).

Go into `config/BasicMazeWorldGenerator` and create a new maze with the CLI App.

For example, run the command:
```bash
./maze-generator -h 36 -w 36 -d 1 -o maze.txt
```
To generate a maze by 36x36 chunks with the difficulty 1 (hard).
This maze will be stored in `maze.txt`.
To understand how it works, just read the `README` in the repo of this project.

Edit now the `config.yaml` and change the path to the stored maze.

For example, this config;
```yaml
maze:
  path: foo/bar/maze.txt
```
Is looking for the maze at this path `foo/bar/maze.txt` inside the **config directory of the plugin**.
The "real" path will be: `config/BasicMazeWorldGenerator/foo/bar/maze.txt`.

Now, modify the file `bukkit.yml` at the root of your server.
Add these lines at the bottom of the file:
```yml
worlds:
  YOUR_WORLD_NAME:
    generator: BasicMazeWorldGenerator
```
Don't forget to replace the `YOUR_WORLD_NAME` by the name of your world (by default it's `world`).
