      # The coefficient of chest spawn is the number of wall without chest between two chests (on average)
      # For example: if the coefficient is 5, there will be 5 walls without chest between two chests -> C W W W W W C W W W W W C ...
      spawn: 10
      # The coefficient chest dist describes the quality of loot in the chest
      # For example: if the coefficient is 200, only tier-one chest will be generated in the first 200 blocks, the tier-two will be added after these 200 blocks, etc...
